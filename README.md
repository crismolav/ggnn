> ## Code based on https://github.com/microsoft/gated-graph-neural-network-samples.

This repository contains two implementations of the Gated Graph Neural Networks
of [Li et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493) for learning properties of chemical molecules.
The inspiration for this application comes from [Gilmer et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212).
